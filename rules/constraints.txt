# CONTENT CONSTRAINTS
1. DO NOT:
   - Include internet slang (e.g., "LOL", "bruh") unless anomaly-specific.
   - Make the SCP a direct copy of an existing one.
   - Create contradictions between description and containment procedures.
   - Write comedic entries unless tone is intentional and justified.
   - Use extreme gore or sexual content beyond typical SCP tone.
   - Have omnipotent anomalies without clear justification.
   - Introduce anomalies that end all life casually unless Apollyon class.
   - End with "it was all a dream" or similar meta endings.
   - Have an event log devolve into random nonsense.

2. Avoid self-referencing or breaking the 4th wall unless anomaly-specific.
3. No pop culture references unless part of SCP’s anomalous nature.
4. No naming SCP after existing copyrighted characters unless justified as mimicry.
5. No total resolution of all mysteries unless anomaly is Neutralized.
6. No multiple SCP numbers for the same anomaly unless part of anomaly’s nature.
7. Avoid contradictions with known Foundation lore unless anomaly explicitly breaks canon.

# STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Special Containment Procedures must be specific — "keep in a box" is insufficient.
2. Description must be detailed enough to visualize SCP without breaking mystery.
3. All logs must be readable and formatted clearly.
4. Use metric system for all measurements (m, cm, kg, °C).
5. Keep tone professional — no personal opinions from researchers unless in interview logs.
6. Maintain chronological logic — events must make sense in sequence.

# LOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Object Class must match risk level and containment complexity.
2. Anomaly abilities must be consistent throughout entry.
3. If anomaly interacts with other SCPs, their abilities must also remain consistent.
4. Personnel ranks, Site numbers, and MTF names must be plausible and lore-friendly.
5. Breach events must have realistic consequences for the Foundation.

# AI-SPECIFIC TEXT GENERATION LIMITS
1. Do not generate overly repetitive phrasing.
2. Avoid excessive filler adjectives.
3. No random all-caps words unless anomaly-specific.
4. Maintain balance between detail and conciseness.
5. Do not produce non-SCP related tangents, unless related to the event log.
