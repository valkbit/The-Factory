SCP Designation: SCP-2935
Object Class: Keter

Assigned Site: USINBL Site-81
Site Director: J. Karlyle Aktus
Research Head: S. Cole Sisson
Assigned Task Force: E-13 "Manifest Destiny"
Location: Joppa, IN, USA

Special Containment Procedures:

The entrance to SCP-2935 has been sealed with concrete. Access to SCP-2935 is strictly forbidden.

Description:

SCP-2935 is a space-time anomaly located within a limestone cave beneath a cemetery near Joppa, Indiana. The cemetery's last recorded interment was in 1908. SCP-2935 was discovered by Foundation personnel after detection of anomalous radio signals emanating from the site (see Addendum 2935.1).

The anomaly contains a near-exact replica of modern Earth in 2016. All life—biological, mechanical, or otherwise sentient—ceased to exist within SCP-2935 on April 20th, 2016. Mobile Task Force reconnaissance indicates this extinction occurred suddenly between 0300–0400 EST. The cause remains unknown.

Addendum 2935.1: Discovery

On April 28th, 2016, at approximately 0500 EST, a distorted radio signal was detected by Site-81 communications personnel. Tracing located the signal near Joppa, Indiana, prompting dispatch of Site-81 agents. SCP-2935 was identified upon investigation of the limestone cave.

Initial drone reconnaissance led personnel to believe the anomaly was merely a cave passage. Confirmation of the anomaly occurred after receiving an undistorted broadcast originating from Site-81 within SCP-2935, repeating a looped emergency message from April 20th, 2016.

“This is an automated emergency broadcast from the SCP Foundation and your national government. One or more of our sites is experiencing a communication breakdown, likely due to a containment breach of unknown magnitude. All citizens are ordered to stay in their homes as containment teams work to secure the breach. This message will broadcast from April 20th, 2016 until—” (message cuts out and repeats)

Mobile Task Force Epsilon-13 "Manifest Destiny" was deployed for further examination.

Addendum 2935.2: Exploration

Exploration occurred over four missions (three manned, one unmanned). Artifacts and information recovered are cataloged in Addendum 2935.3.
