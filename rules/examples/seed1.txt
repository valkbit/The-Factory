Item #: SCP-4872  
Object Class: Euclid  

Special Containment Procedures:  
SCP-4872 is to be contained in a reinforced humanoid containment chamber at Site-41. The chamber must be equipped with dual-layer acoustic insulation and monitored by two (2) Level 3 personnel at all times.  

All personnel assigned to SCP-4872 must undergo quarterly auditory baseline testing. In the event that any staff begin humming the melody designated 4872-A outside of approved testing, they are to be quarantined immediately and administered Class-C amnestics.  

Testing with SCP-4872 requires written authorization from the Site Director and must be conducted in an anechoic chamber to prevent unintentional propagation of 4872-A.  

Description:  
SCP-4872 is a humanoid entity resembling an adult male of unknown ethnicity, approximately 1.74 m in height, with no hair and a uniformly matte-black epidermis. SCP-4872’s surface reflects less than 1% of incident light, making it appear as a silhouette in all lighting conditions.  

SCP-4872 is capable of producing a continuous vocal melody (4872-A) with no apparent need for respiration. Exposure to 4872-A for more than thirty (30) seconds results in subjects involuntarily memorizing and replicating the tune.  

Replication of 4872-A, even by non-anomalous individuals, induces a mild compulsion in listeners to join in the melody. Prolonged collective exposure (greater than 6 minutes) leads to subjects entering a synchronized catatonic state. Subjects in this state remain standing, humming the tune indefinitely until removed from auditory range and treated.  

SCP-4872 was recovered from ███████, Norway, after local reports of “the black singer” coincided with the disappearance of twelve (12) hikers. MTF Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox") successfully contained SCP-4872 after an operation lasting 36 hours, during which four (4) operatives were affected and quarantined.

Note: Interview terminated after Dr. Kessler began humming in response to SCP-4872’s melody. Subject was quarantined and cleared after amnestic administration.  

Addendum 4872-2 – Incident Report 4872-B:  
On 2024-05-14, during routine containment check, acoustic insulation in SCP-4872’s chamber was found partially compromised due to material degradation. Two guards posted outside the chamber began whistling an approximation of 4872-A during inspection. Both were removed from duty pending psychological evaluation. Chamber insulation replaced with higher-grade composite material.
