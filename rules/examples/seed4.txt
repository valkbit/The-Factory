Item #: SCP-9182  
Object Class: Keter  

Special Containment Procedures:  
SCP-9182 is to be contained within a reinforced subterranean vault at Site-19. The vault walls are to be lined with adaptive magnetic shielding to prevent unauthorized movement of SCP-9182’s metallic fragments. Access is strictly forbidden without O5 approval.  

Description:  
SCP-9182 is an amorphous, semi-sentient mass of metallic fragments capable of rapid self-assembly. SCP-9182 demonstrates hostile behavior toward all living entities on sight and is capable of forming temporary structures, weapons, and tools from its components.  

SCP-9182 propagates by disassembling and reassembling within 500 meters, making standard containment ineffective. A breach event in 2023 resulted in the temporary isolation of Site-19. SCP-9182 was recaptured using an experimental electromagnetic disruption array.  

Addendum 9182-1 – Incident Log:  
During the breach, SCP-9182 assimilated several security drones, forming composite weaponized entities. Casualties included 7 security personnel and 3 MTF operatives. Following this event, containment protocols were revised to include remote electromagnetic monitoring and automated neutralization procedures.
