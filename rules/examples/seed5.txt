Item #: SCP-6214  
Object Class: Keter  

Special Containment Procedures:  
SCP-6214 cannot be physically contained due to its spatial and dimensional properties. A 10 km exclusion zone has been established around the known entrance coordinates in ███████, Siberia. Warning markers, surveillance drones, and automatic perimeter defenses are to be maintained at all times.  

All personnel entering SCP-6214 require Level 4 authorization, psychological clearance, and emergency extraction protocols. No personnel are allowed to enter alone. UAV reconnaissance is mandatory before any manned expedition.  

Description:  
SCP-6214 is a naturally occurring cavern system that extends infinitely beyond known geological limits. The entrance resembles a narrow crevasse approximately 1.2 meters wide, but internal exploration reveals large chambers, endless tunnels, and spatial anomalies that defy conventional mapping.  

Time and distance inside SCP-6214 appear inconsistent: individuals report spending days inside, while external time shows only hours. GPS and compass devices fail, often showing impossible coordinates or circular loops.  

SCP-6214 is inhabited by entities designated SCP-6214-1. These entities are humanoid in appearance but semi-transparent, silent, and aggressive when approached. Direct contact has resulted in immediate disappearance or reappearance far from the entry point.  

The deeper an expedition penetrates, the more extreme the anomalies become: gravitational shifts, disappearing floors, and rooms that repeat infinitely. Several exploratory teams have reported auditory hallucinations, distorted reflections of themselves, and encounters with impossible architecture.  

Addendum 6214-1 – Recovery Log:  
SCP-6214 was first reported in 1997 following the disappearance of a group of loggers. Initial MTF Gamma-9 (“Snow Leopards”) expeditions confirmed the anomaly’s existence after multiple team members failed to return. Attempts to map the interior have been unsuccessful due to non-Euclidean geometry.  

Addendum 6214-2 – Incident Report 6214-A:  
During an unauthorized expedition in 2021, a D-class team entered SCP-6214 and did not return. Audio recordings captured from drones show the team discussing hallways that “loop forever” and “seeing each other from impossible angles.” All personnel were declared lost.  

Addendum 6214-3 – Research Notes:  
- SCP-6214 shows properties consistent with localized spacetime distortion.  
- Magnetic and gravitational anomalies increase with depth.  
- Prolonged exposure to SCP-6214 causes psychological effects, including paranoia, derealization, and compulsive exploration behavior.  

Note: Due to extreme hazard potential and uncontainable nature, SCP-6214 is to be monitored remotely. Any civilian approach is to be neutralized with lethal force if necessary.
