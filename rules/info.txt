# SCP FOUNDATION OVERVIEW
The SCP Foundation is a global, clandestine organization responsible for securing, containing, and protecting anomalies—objects, entities, and phenomena that violate natural law. Its motto is "Secure, Contain, Protect."

The Foundation operates in complete secrecy to prevent mass panic, protect humanity, and ensure anomalies are studied under controlled conditions.

The Foundation has worldwide reach, with facilities known as "Sites" and "Areas" located both above and below ground, often in remote or hidden locations.

# CORE OPERATIONS
1. SECURE – Locate anomalies and prevent public awareness.
2. CONTAIN – Keep anomalies isolated and under control.
3. PROTECT – Safeguard humanity and maintain normalcy.

# ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
- Overseen by the O5 Council (O5-1 to O5-13), the highest level of authority in the Foundation.
- Administration is hierarchical, with strict security clearances.
- Most personnel do not have full knowledge of the Foundation's activities.
- Departments include:
  - Research & Containment
  - Security & Tactical Response
  - Medical & Psychological Services
  - Logistics & Support
  - Ethics Committee

# SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVELS
- **Level 0 – For Official Use Only**: Minimal access; janitorial staff, basic clerks.
- **Level 1 – Confidential**: Low-level staff with basic knowledge of anomalies.
- **Level 2 – Restricted**: Technical staff, junior researchers, field agents.
- **Level 3 – Secret**: Senior researchers, high-risk containment staff.
- **Level 4 – Top Secret**: Site Directors, senior project leads, regional heads.
- **Level 5 – Overseer Clearance**: O5 Council, access to all files.

# PERSONNEL TYPES
- **Research Staff** – Scientists studying anomalies.
- **Security Personnel** – Guards, containment specialists.
- **Mobile Task Forces (MTFs)** – Elite teams for high-risk missions (see MTF section).
- **Field Agents** – Operatives embedded in the public to detect anomalies.
- **Medical & Psychological Staff** – Treat injuries and monitor mental stability.
- **D-Class Personnel** – Prisoners used for dangerous testing, typically terminated monthly.

# MOBILE TASK FORCES (MTFs)
Specialized, rapid-response units with unique designations and roles.
Examples:
- MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") – O5 Council’s personal security and enforcement.
- MTF Beta-7 ("Maz Hatters") – Biohazard containment.
- MTF Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox") – Site security breach response.
- MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") – Large-scale combat operations.
- MTF Tau-5 ("Samsara") – Experimental, cybernetic soldiers.

# SCP DESIGNATIONS
Each anomaly is assigned an SCP number (e.g., SCP-173) and categorized by object class.

# OBJECT CLASSES
## Primary Classes
- **Safe** – Easily and safely contained. Risk is minimal if procedures are followed.
- **Euclid** – Unpredictable or not fully understood; containment is more complex.
- **Keter** – Difficult or impossible to contain reliably; often hostile or highly dangerous.
- **Thaumiel** – Anomalies used to contain or neutralize other anomalies.
- **Neutralized** – No longer anomalous.

## Additional / Unofficial Classes
- **Apollyon** – Unstoppable anomaly leading to inevitable world-ending scenarios.
- **Archon** – Anomaly that should not be contained for various reasons.

# CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES
- Must be specific to the anomaly’s properties.
- Include environmental conditions, security measures, and emergency protocols.
- Should prevent unauthorized access and accidental exposure.
- May involve technological, chemical, biological, or anomalous countermeasures.

# EVENT LOGS & INCIDENT REPORTS
- Used to record breaches, tests, interviews, and other significant events.
- Written in a formal, factual style.
- May include redactions (████) and expunged details ([DATA EXPUNGED]) to simulate classified information.
- Dates, times, and locations must be clearly marked.

# FOUNDATION "LAWS" AND TONE RULES
- Operates with extreme secrecy; public must remain unaware, if at any point the public becomes aware of anomalies, amnestics must be administered.
- Foundation is pragmatic, willing to sacrifice personnel to maintain containment.
- Ethics Committee exists, but security often overrides morality.
- All information is compartmentalized; personnel know only what is necessary.
- SCP entries are written in a formal, clinical tone unless anomaly nature requires otherwise.
- Redactions are common and used for security purposes.
- Humor is rare and usually unintentional, except in anomalies that inherently cause comedic effects.
- Events are to be internally consistent with the anomaly’s abilities and lore.

# KNOWN ENTITY TYPES
- **Anomalous Object** – Non-living item with unusual properties.
- **Anomalous Entity** – Living or sentient anomaly.
- **Anomalous Location** – Geographic area with abnormal effects.
- **Anomalous Phenomenon** – Effect or event not tied to a specific object or creature.

# INTERVIEW & TEST FORMAT
- Interviews are Q&A between a researcher and an SCP or witness.
- Tests follow structured experiments, often with D-Class personnel.
- Both are documented verbatim unless classified.

# STANDARD LORE POINTS
- D-Class are replaced monthly to prevent long-term exposure risks.
- O5 Council identities are top secret; some may be anomalies themselves.
- Mobile Task Forces are highly specialized; names and designations reflect roles.
- Some anomalies are beneficial but are still contained to prevent misuse.
- The Foundation sometimes works with other Groups of Interest (GoIs), such as:
  - Global Occult Coalition (GOC) – Military anomaly suppression.
  - Chaos Insurgency – Rogue Foundation splinter group.
  - Serpent’s Hand – Pro-anomaly activists.
  - Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd. – Anomalous item black market.
- Knowledge of anomalies can be dangerous; memetic hazards exist.
- The Foundation uses amnestics to erase civilian memories of anomalies.

# WRITING STYLE NOTES FOR SCP ENTRIES
- Maintain a detached, professional tone.
- Avoid excessive exposition; focus on observed facts.
- Use metric measurements (m, kg, °C).
- Present details logically, starting with containment, then description, then events or addenda.
- Redact sensitive details using ███ or [DATA EXPUNGED].
- Avoid pop culture references unless anomaly nature justifies it.
- Each SCP should feel like part of a consistent, shared universe.
