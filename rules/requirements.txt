# GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL SCP ENTRIES
1. Every SCP entry must contain the following sections in order:
   a. Item #: SCP-#### (four/five-digit designation number, no duplicates with example SCPs)
   b. Object Class (Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel, etc.)
   c. Special Containment Procedures (clear, specific, and logically consistent)
   d. Description (physical form, abilities, behaviors, origin theories)
   e. Optional: Addenda (interview logs, test logs, incident reports, discovery notes)

2. All SCP entries must follow SCP Foundation tone:
   - Formal, detached, scientific style.
   - No casual slang unless anomaly-specific.
   - No excessive humor unless the SCP is inherently comedic.

3. Containment Procedures Requirements:
   - Must match the SCP’s threat level and abilities.
   - Include location (Site/Area designation) and chamber specifications.
   - Include security measures (personnel level, weapons, environmental conditions).
   - Describe emergency response in case of breach.
   - Mention specific containment tools if relevant (restraints, scramblers, chemical agents).

4. Description Requirements:
   - Explain appearance, behavior, abilities, and effects.
   - Provide measurable data where possible (size, weight, temperature, speed, etc.).
   - Include limitations of the anomaly if known.
   - If origin is unknown, explicitly state this.
   - Avoid omnipotence unless justified and matched with an appropriate class.

5. Object Class Assignment:
   - Must fit the SCP’s properties and containment difficulty.
   - Keter must be justified with actual difficulty, not just danger.
   - Thaumiel must be justified with containment utility.

6. Redactions and Security:
   - Use ███ or [DATA EXPUNGED] for classified info.
   - Redactions must feel purposeful, not random.
   - If referencing a Group of Interest, it must match existing lore.

7. Lore Integration:
   - May reference Foundation personnel, Sites, Areas, and Mobile Task Forces.
   - Any named personnel must have plausible roles.
   - Any GoI interaction must be consistent with known relationships.

8. Mystery Element:
   - At least one unexplained or uncertain element must remain.
   - Avoid total closure unless anomaly is Neutralized.

# REQUIREMENTS FOR EVENT LOGS / INCIDENT REPORTS
1. Must include:
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD) and optionally time (HH:MM:SS).
   - Location (Site/Area number or field location).
   - Participants with rank/role (e.g., Dr. ███, Agent ████, D-####).
   - Clear, factual sequence of events.

2. Logs must reflect:
   - SCP abilities and containment procedures accurately.
   - Appropriate Foundation responses for breach/incident severity.
   - Consistent escalation; no sudden unrelated events.

3. Acceptable Log Types:
   - Interview logs (dialogue between researcher and SCP/witness).
   - Test logs (controlled experiments on the SCP).
   - Incident reports (breaches, casualties, property damage).
   - Discovery logs (initial contact with SCP).

4. Logs should avoid:
   - Overly long, unrelated tangents.
   - Repetition of information already in the description.
   - Jokes or slang unless anomaly-specific.

# FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Must remain internally consistent with SCP’s abilities and object class.
- Should not exceed 2,000 words unless marked long-form.
- Must feel like an authentic SCP Foundation document.
